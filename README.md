## Project Description:
The project involves developing a user-written game reviews website. Since opinions on games are subjective, we believe that most people would prefer to read several reviews from everyday players in addition to, or instead of, professional articles. Users can search for name of game they want to read a review or write a review. The website will display the information of the game (e.g., name, description, release date, developer, and publisher) and reviews that are written by other users. Three entities that will undergo CRUD operations are games, reviews, and users.
